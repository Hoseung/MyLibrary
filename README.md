# MyLibrary
Organize papers so that relevance papers is easily assessable.

This is a 4-week daily coding project. 
I am planning to build a Python app which will help me to follow other's researches. 
It's my first time playing with the web, I have no idea how doable it will be...


## Most wanted functionalities 
1. retrieve meta data of new papers based on a simple, keyword/author-based matching, algorithm. It will be best if this can be substituted by a machine learning algorithm (in the far future) like what Mendeley and Nature maybe doing. 
2. analize mutual citations of the papers in my library. Define the **central** paper in each field and devise a measurement of relevance. Until I figure out the best "formula" for the relevance assessment, manual modification of the weighting shold be possible.
3. Add a searchable note to each paper.
4. Very basic GUI (probably using QT?)
5. Automatically determine 
6.

## Optional features
1. Visualize the network of citations.
2. Automatically check if an arxiv paper has been published (by checking on ADS)
3. Main text search.
