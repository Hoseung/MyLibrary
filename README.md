# MyLibrary
organize papers so that relevance of each paper is visible.

This is a 4-week daily coding project. 
I am planning to build a Python app which will help to follow other's researches. 
It's my first time playing with the web, I have no idea how doable it will be. 


Most wanted functionalities. 
a. retrieve meta data of new papers based on a simple, keyword/author-based matching, algorithm. It will be best if this can be substituted by a machine learning algorithm (in the far future) like what Mendeley and Nature maybe doing. 
b. analize mutual citations of the papers in my library. Define the **central** paper in each field and devise a measurement of relevance. Until I figure out the best "formula" for the relevance assessment, manual modification of the weighting shold be possible.
c. Add a searchable note to each paper.
d. Very basic GUI (probably using QT?)
e. Automatically determine 
f.

Optional features
a. Visualize the network of citations.
b. Automatically check if an arxiv paper has been published (by checking on ADS)
c.
