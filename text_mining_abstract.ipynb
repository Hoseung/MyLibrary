      "The unprecedented depth and area surveyed by the Subaru Strategic Program with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC-SSP) have enabled us to construct and publish the largest distant cluster sample out to {\\$}z\\backslashsim 1{\\$} to date. In this exploratory study of cluster galaxy evolution from {\\$}z=1{\\$} to {\\$}z=0.3{\\$}, we investigate the stellar mass assembly history of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and evolution of stellar mass and luminosity distributions, stellar mass surface density profile, as well as the population of radio galaxies. Our analysis is the first high redshift application of the top N richest cluster selection, which is shown to allow us to trace the cluster galaxy evolution faithfully. Our stellar mass is derived from a machine-learning algorithm, which we show to be unbiased and accurate with respect to the COSMOS data. We find very mild stellar mass growth in BCGs, and no evidence for evolution in both the total stellar mass-cluster mass correlation and the shape of the stellar mass surface density profile. We also present the first measurement of the radio luminosity distribution in clusters out to {\\$}z\\backslashsim 1{\\$}.\n",
      "We examine subhaloes and galaxies residing in a simulated LCDM galaxy cluster ({\\$}M{\\^{}}{\\{}\\backslashrm crit{\\}}{\\_}{\\{}200{\\}}=1.1\\backslashtimes10{\\^{}}{\\{}15{\\}}M{\\_}\\backslashodot/h{\\$}) produced by hydrodynamical codes ranging from classic Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), newer SPH codes, adaptive and moving mesh codes. These codes use subgrid models to capture galaxy formation physics. We compare how well these codes reproduce the same subhaloes/galaxies in gravity only, non-radiative hydrodynamics and full feedback physics runs by looking at the overall subhalo/galaxy distribution and on an individual objects basis. We find the subhalo population is reproduced to within {\\$}\\backslashlesssim10\\backslash{\\%}{\\$} for both dark matter only and non-radiative runs, with individual objects showing code-to-code scatter of {\\$}\\backslashlesssim0.1{\\$} dex, although the gas in non-radiative simulations shows significant scatter. Including feedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and {\\$}V{\\_}{\\{}max{\\}}{\\$} distributions vary by {\\$}\\backslashapprox20\\backslash{\\%}{\\$}. The galaxy populations also show striking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar in almost all codes, the number of galaxies with {\\$}10{\\^{}}{\\{}9{\\}}M{\\_}\\backslashodot/h\\backslashlesssim M{\\_}*\\backslashlesssim 10{\\^{}}{\\{}12{\\}}M{\\_}\\backslashodot/h{\\$} can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies show code-to-code scatter of {\\$}\\backslashsim0.5{\\$} dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong systematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies {\\$}70\\backslash{\\%}{\\$} smaller than others. The diversity partially arises from the inclusion/absence of AGN feedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that subgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of building galaxies in all environments remains a challenge. We argue even basic galaxy properties, such as the stellar mass to halo mass, should be treated with errors bars of {\\$}\\backslashsim0.2-0.4{\\$} dex.\n",
      "We present an investigation of the dependence of galaxy kinematics on the environment for a sample of 94 star-forming galaxies at {\\$}z\\backslashsim0.9{\\$} from the ORELSE survey. ORELSE is a large photometric and spectroscopic campaign dedicated to mapping out and characterizing galaxy properties across a full range of environments in 15 fields containing large-scale structures (LSSs) in a redshift range of {\\$}0.6 {\\textless} z {\\textless} 1.3{\\$}. We constrained the rotation velocity for our kinematic sample in an ORELSE field, containing the SC1604 supercluster, by fitting high-resolution semi-analytical models to the data. We constructed the stellar-mass/B-band Tully-Fisher relation and found no dependence of the intrinsic scatter on both local and global environment. Moreover, we compared the stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio ({\\$}M{\\_}\\backslashast/M{\\_}{\\{}dyn{\\}}{\\$}) of SC1604 galaxies to those residing in less dense local environment by leveraging data from the HR-COSMOS sample. We found that, at fixed stellar mass, SC1604 galaxies have {\\$}\\backslashsim30\\backslash{\\%}{\\$} smaller dynamical masses on average. By comparing the distributions of the galaxy parameters that define {\\$}M{\\_}{\\{}dyn{\\}}{\\$} (i.e., circular velocity and the characteristic radius {\\$}r{\\_}{\\{}2.2{\\}}{\\$}) between SC1604 and HR-COSMOS, we found that smaller dynamical masses are mostly caused by smaller {\\$}r{\\_}{\\{}2.2{\\}}{\\$} for SC1604 galaxies. We also observed that SC1604 galaxies in general show {\\$}\\backslashsim20\\backslash{\\%}{\\$} lower stellar specific angular momentum ({\\$}j{\\_}\\backslashast{\\$}) with respect to the HR-COSMOS sample. Adopting literature estimates for (1) the excess rate of galaxy-galaxy mergers in intermediate/high-density environments and (2) the average amount of {\\$}j{\\_}\\backslashast{\\$} loss per merger event, we investigated the possibility that galaxy mergers are mainly responsible for the loss of angular momentum in higher density environments.\n",
      "We use the galaxy stellar mass and halo merger tree information from the semi-analytic model galaxy catalogue of Font et al. (2009) to examine the accretion of galaxies into a large sample of groups and clusters, covering a wide range in halo mass (10E12.9 to 10E15.3 Msun/h), and selected from each of four redshift epochs (z=0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). We find that clusters at all examined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxy populations through galaxy groups. A 10E14.5 Msun/h mass cluster at z=0 has, on average, accreted {\\~{}} 40{\\%} of its galaxies (Mstellar {\\textgreater} 10E9 Msun/h) from halos with masses greater than 10E13 Msun/h. Further, the galaxies which are accreted through groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted through smaller halos or from the field population. We find that at a given epoch, the fraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of the final cluster or group mass. In contrast, we find that observing a cluster of the same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates of isolated galaxies, from 5-6 {\\%} per Gyr at z=0 to 15{\\%} per Gyr at z=1.5. We find that combining the existence of a Butcher Oemler effect at z=0.5 and the observations that galaxies within groups display significant environmental effects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions. Namely, that the dominant environmental process must begin to occur in halos of 10E12 -- 10E13 Msun/h, and act over timescales of {\\textgreater} 2 Gyrs. This argues in favor of a mechanism like \"strangulation\", in which the hot halo of a galaxy is stripped upon infalling into a more massive halo . This simple model predicts that by z=1.5 galaxy groups and clusters will display little to no environmental effects.\n",
      "We have simulated the formation of a massive galaxy cluster (M{\\$}{\\_}{\\{}200{\\}}{\\^{}}{\\{}\\backslashrm crit{\\}}{\\$} = 1.1{\\$}\\backslashtimes{\\$}10{\\$}{\\^{}}{\\{}15{\\}}h{\\^{}}{\\{}-1{\\}}M{\\_}{\\{}\\backslashodot{\\}}{\\$}) in a {\\$}\\backslashLambda{\\$}CDM universe using 10 different codes (RAMSES, 2 incarnations of AREPO and 7 of GADGET), modeling hydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. These codes include Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), spanning traditional and advanced SPH schemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. Our goal is to study the consistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiative physical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and AGN feedback. We compare images of the cluster at {\\$}z=0{\\$}, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. We find that, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrally concentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of AGN feedback. The scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than for non-radiative runs. Intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washed away the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen for non-radiative simulations in Sembolini et al. (2015): radiative physics + classic SPH can produce entropy cores. Furthermore, the inclusion/absence of AGN feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellar content- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and a falling central entropy profile. However, AGN feedback does strongly affect the overall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducing sensibly the stellar fraction.\n",
      "We analyse the Kormendy relations (KRs) of the two Frontier Fields clusters, Abell S1063, at z = 0.348, and MACS J1149.5+2223, at z = 0.542, exploiting very deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry and VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy. With this novel dataset, we are able to investigate how the KR parameters depend on the cluster galaxy sample selection and how this affects studies of galaxy evolution based on the KR. We define and compare four different galaxy samples according to: (a) S$\\backslash$'ersic indices: early-type ('ETG'), (b) visual inspection: 'ellipticals', (c) colours: 'red', (d) spectral properties: 'passive'. The classification is performed for a complete sample of galaxies with m{\\$}{\\_}{\\{}\\backslashtextit{\\{}F814W{\\}}{\\}} \\backslashle{\\$} 22.5 ABmag (M{\\$}{\\_}{\\{}*{\\}}{\\$} {\\$}\\backslashgtrsim 10{\\^{}}{\\{}10.0{\\}}{\\$} M{\\$}{\\_}{\\{}\\backslashodot{\\}}{\\$}). To derive robust galaxy structural parameters, we use two methods: (1) an iterative estimate of structural parameters using images of increasing size, in order to deal with closely separated galaxies and (2) different background estimations, to deal with the Intracluster light contamination. The comparison between the KRs obtained from the different samples suggests that the sample selection could affect the estimate of the best-fitting KR parameters. The KR built with ETGs is fully consistent with the one obtained for ellipticals and passive. On the other hand, the KR slope built on the red sample is only marginally consistent with those obtained with the other samples. We also release the photometric catalogue with structural parameters for the galaxies included in the present analysis.\n",
      "Galaxies in clusters are more likely to be of early type and to have lower star formation rates than galaxies in the field. Recent observations and simulations suggest that cluster galaxies may be `pre-processed' by group or filament environments and that galaxies that fall into a cluster as part of a larger group can stay coherent within the cluster for up to one orbital period (`post-processing'). We investigate these ideas by means of a cosmological {\\$}N{\\$}-body simulation and idealized {\\$}N{\\$}-body plus hydrodynamics simulations of a group-cluster merger. We find that group environments can contribute significantly to galaxy pre-processing by means of enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, removal of galaxies' hot halo gas by ram pressure stripping, and tidal truncation of their galaxies. Tidal distortion of the group during infall does not contribute to pre-processing. Post-processing is also shown to be effective: galaxy-galaxy collisions are enhanced during a group's pericentric passage within a cluster, the merger shock enhances the ram pressure on group and cluster galaxies, and an increase in local density during the merger leads to greater galactic tidal truncation.\n",
      "While galaxies move through the intracluster medium of their host cluster, they experience a ram pressure which removes at least a significant part of their interstellar medium. This ram pressure stripping appears to be especially important for spiral galaxies: this scenario is a good candidate to explain the differences observed between cluster spirals in the nearby universe and their field counterparts. Thus, ram pressure stripping of disk galaxies in clusters has been studied intensively during the last decade. I review advances made in this area, concentrating on theoretical work, but continuously comparing to observations.\n",
      "Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass, and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR {\\~{}} 10{\\^{}}-11 yr{\\^{}}-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 x 10{\\^{}}11 Msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halo center. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond {\\~{}}2R{\\_}vir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within {\\~{}}R{\\_}vir of a more massive host halo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyrs, and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.\n",
      "Integrated star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (SFR/M*), derived from the spectroscopic data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 4 (DR4), are used to show that the star formation activity in galaxies (M r ≤ -20.5) found on the outskirts (1-2r 200) of some nearby clusters (0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.15) is enhanced. By comparing the mean SFR of galaxies in a sample of clusters with at least one starburst galaxy (log SFR/M* ≥ -10yr -1 and SFR ≥ 10 M ⊙yr -1) to a sample of clusters without such galaxies ('comparison' clusters), we find that despite the expected decline in the mean SFR of galaxies towards the cluster core, the SFR profile of the two samples is different. Compared to the clusters with at least one starburst galaxy on their outskirts, the galaxies in the 'comparison' clusters show a lower mean SFR at all radius (≤3r 200) from the cluster centre. Such an increase in the SFR of galaxies is more likely to be seen in dynamically unrelaxed ($\\sigma$ v ≳ 500kms -1) clusters. It is also evident that these unrelaxed clusters are currently being assembled via galaxies falling in through straight filaments, resulting in high velocity dispersions. On the other hand, 'comparison' clusters are more likely to be fed by relatively low density filaments. We find that the starburst galaxies on the periphery of clusters are in an environment of higher local density than other cluster galaxies at similar radial distances from the cluster centre. We conclude that a relatively high galaxy density in the infalling regions of clusters promotes interactions amongst galaxies, leading to momentary bursts of star formation. Such interactions play a crucial role in exhausting the fuel for star formation in a galaxy, before it is expelled due to the environmental processes that are operational in the dense interiors of the cluster. {\\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.\n",
      "We have simulated the formation of a galaxy cluster in a {\\$}\\backslashLambda{\\$}CDM universe using twelve different codes modeling only gravity and non-radiative hydrodynamics ($\\backslash$art, $\\backslash$arepo, $\\backslash$hydra$\\backslash$ and 9 incarnations of GADGET). This range of codes includes particle based, moving and fixed mesh codes as well as both Eulerian and Lagrangian fluid schemes. The various GADGET implementations span traditional and advanced smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes. The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at {\\$}z=0{\\$}, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. The underlying gravitational framework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailed investigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physics implementations employed. As expected, the mesh-based codes ART and AREPO form extended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. Those codes employing traditional SPH schemes show falling entropy profiles all the way into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles and central temperature inversions. We show that methods with modern SPH schemes that allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and the latest SPH variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentially indistinguishable from those obtained with grid based methods.\n",
      "We present data for 16 galaxies in the overdensity JKCS 041 at {\\$}z \\backslashsimeq 1.80{\\$} as part of the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) Cluster Survey (KCS). With 20-hour integrations, we have obtained deep absorption-line spectra from which we derived velocity dispersions for seven quiescent galaxies. We combined photometric parameters derived from Hubble Space Telescope images with the dispersions to construct a fundamental plane (FP) for quiescent galaxies in JKCS 041. From the zero-point evolution of the FP, we derived a formation redshift for the galaxies of {\\$}z{\\_}{\\{}form{\\}} = 3.0\\backslashpm0.3{\\$}, corresponding to a mean age of {\\$}1.4\\backslashpm0.2{\\$} Gyrs. We tested the effect of structural and velocity dispersion evolution on our FP zero point and found a negligible contribution when using dynamical mass-normalized parameters ({\\$}\\backslashsim 3\\backslash{\\%}{\\$}), but a significant contribution from stellar-mass-normalized parameters ({\\$}\\backslashsim 42 \\backslash{\\%}{\\$}). From the relative velocities of the galaxies, we probed the three-dimensional structure of these 16 confirmed members of JKCS 041, and found that a group of galaxies in the south west of the overdensity had systematically higher velocities. We derived ages for the galaxies in the different groups from the FP. We found the east-extending group had typically older galaxies ({\\$}2.1\\backslashsubstack{\\{}+0.3\\backslash\\backslash-0.2{\\}}{\\$} Gyrs), than those in the south-west group ({\\$}0.3\\backslashpm0.2{\\$} Gyrs). Although based on small numbers, the overdensity dynamics, morphology, and age results could indicate that JKCS 041 is in formation and may comprise two merging groups of galaxies. The result could link large-scale structure to ages of galaxies for the first time at this redshift.\n",
      "In this work, we present the results of a novel approach devoted to disentangling the role of the environmental processes affecting galaxies in clusters. This is based on the analysis of the near-UV (NUV) - r' distributions of a large sample of star-forming galaxies in clusters spanning more than four absolute magnitudes. The galaxies inhabit three distinct environmental regions: virial regions, cluster infall regions, and field environment. We have applied rigorous statistical tests to analyze both the complete NUV - r' distributions and their averages for three different bins of the r'-band galaxy luminosity down to M{\\_}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}r{\\^{}}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}{\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}prime {\\$}{\\}}{\\$}{\\$}{\\}}{\\$} {\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}sim -18, throughout the three environmental regions considered. We have identified the environmental processes that significantly affect the star-forming galaxies in a given luminosity bin by using criteria based on the characteristics of these processes: their typical timescales, the regions where they operate, and the galaxy luminosity range for which their effects are more intense. We have found that the high-luminosity (M{\\_}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}r{\\^{}}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}{\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}prime {\\$}{\\}}{\\$}{\\$}{\\}}{\\$} {\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}le -20) star-forming galaxies do not show significant signs in their star formation activity of being affected by: (1) the environment in the last ∼10⁸ yr, or (2) a sudden quenching in the last 1.5 Gyr. The intermediate-luminosity (-20{\\l}t M{\\_}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}r{\\^{}}{\\$}{\\{}{\\$}{\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}prime {\\$}{\\}}{\\$}{\\$}{\\}}{\\$} {\\$}\\backslashbackslash{\\$}le -19) star-forming galaxies appear to be affected by starvation in the virial regions and by the harassment in the virial and infall regions. Low-luminosity (-19) star-forming galaxies seem to be affected by the same environmental processes as intermediate-luminosity star-forming galaxies in a stronger way, which would be expected for their lower luminosities.\n",
      "We present the ellipticity distribution and its evolution for early-type galaxies in clusters from z{\\~{}} 0.8 to the current epoch, based on the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (0.04 {\\textless}z{\\textless}0.07) and the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (0.4{\\textless}z{\\textless}0.8). We first investigate a mass-limited sample and we find that above a fixed mass limit (M{\\_}*‚{\\^{a}}• 10{\\^{}}10.2 M{\\_}»{\\O}), the ellipticity ({\\ldots}{\\~{o}}) distribution of early-type galaxies notably evolves with redshift. In the local Universe, there are proportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than in distant clusters. This evolution is due partly to the change in the mass distribution and mainly to the change in the morphological mix with z among the early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from {\\`{A}}{\\'{u}}70 per cent at high z to {\\`{A}}{\\'{u}}40 per cent at low z). Analysing separately the ellipticity distribution of the different morphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and for S0s. However, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of the distributions is detected. This is due to a larger population of very round ({\\ldots}{\\~{o}} {\\textless} 0.05) elliptical galaxies at low z. In order to compare our finding to previous studies, we also assemble a magnitude-'delimited' sample that consists of early-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3 {\\textgreater} M{\\_}B+ 1.208z {\\textgreater} -21. Analysing this sample, we do not recover exactly the same results as the mass-limited sample. This indicates that the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galactic properties: the choice of the magnitude-'delimited' sample implies the loss of many less-massive galaxies and so it biases the final conclusions. Moreover, although we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in the magnitude-'delimited' sample are also not in agreement with those of Holden et al. This is due to the fact that our and their low-zsamples have a different magnitude distribution because the Holden et al. sample suffers from incompleteness at faint magnitudes.\n",
      "Galaxy clusters are excellent cosmological probes provided that their formation and evolution within the large scale environment are precisely understood. Therefore studies with simulated galaxy clusters have flourished. However detailed comparisons between simulated and observed clusters and their population - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and their surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as early as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the details, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under study within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have emerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper highlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that not only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local clusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity uncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the simulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the distance from us. This method has the particularity to use solely radial peculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density constraints are required to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host dark matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma. Zoom-in simulations of the latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h radius inner sphere become now possible to study local clusters and their effects. Mapping the local Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and Sachs-Wolfe effects can follow.\n",

This technique allowed us to obtain unprecedented high spatial resolution (???25 kpc/h) up to the distance of ???3 virial radii from the clusters center, and makes it possible to focus with the same level of detail on the physical properties of the innermost and of the outermost cluster regions, providing new clues on the role of shock waves and turbulent motions in the ICM, across a wide range of scales. In this paper, a first exploratory study of this data set is presented. We report on the thermal properties of galaxy clusters at z = 0. Integrated and morphological properties of gas density, gas temperature, gas entropy and baryon fraction distributions are discussed, and compared with existing outcomes both from the observational and from the numerical literature. Our cluster sample shows an overall good consistency with the results obtained adopting other numerical techniques (e.g. Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics), yet it provides a more accurate representation of the accretion patterns far outside the cluster cores. We also reconstruct the properties of shock waves within the sample by means of a velocity-based approach, and we study Mach numbers and energy distributions for the various dynamical states in clusters, giving estimates for the injection of Cosmic Rays particles at shocks. The present sample is rather unique in the panorama of cosmological simulations of massive galaxy clusters, due to its dynamical range, statistics of objects and number of time outputs. For this reason, we deploy a public repository of the available data, accessible via web portal at http://data.cineca.it. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",
      "Multiwavelength data indicate that the X-ray-emitting plasma in the cores of galaxy clusters is not cooling catastrophically. To a large extent, cooling is offset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) via jets. The cool-core clusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some cooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is locally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of multiphase gas in cluster cores heated by collimated bipolar AGN jets. Our key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only when the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall timescales (t TI/t ff) falls below a critical threshold of ≈10. When this happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot intracluster medium (ICM) phase and generates inhomogeneous and spatially extended H$\\alpha$ filaments. These cold gas clumps and filaments \"rain\" down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold rotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently, the self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a higher entropy level with t TI/t ff {\\textgreater} 10. Eventually, the core reaches quasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the hot ICM whenever t TI/t ff {\\textless}{\\~{}} 10. This occurs despite the fact that the energy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion. The effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the turbulent motions in the wake of freely falling cold filaments. Increased AGN activity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas away from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially extended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized simulations.\n",
      "NEARBY clusters of galaxies are filled with red elliptical 'E' and lenticular 'SO' galaxies1, while younger clusters (at redshifts of {\\textgreater}{\\~{}} 0.4) contain substantial populations of blue spiral galaxies with morphological peculiarities2-7 (see Fig. 1). Thus, within the last 4-5 billion years, galaxies in clusters underwent strong evolution that completely changed their character. By contrast, galaxies that are not associated with clusters show far less morphological evolution8. Here we propose that multiple highspeed encounters between galaxies-'galaxy harassment'- drives the morphological evolution in clusters. Our simulations show that these encounters are very different from mergers; they transform small disk galaxies into dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Harassment will leave detectable debris arcs and could provide fuel for quasars in sub-luminous host galaxies.\n",
      "Observational studies of galaxy isophotal shapes have shown that galaxy orientations are anisotropic: a galaxy's long axis tends to be oriented toward the center of its host. This radial alignment is seen across a wide range of scales, from galaxies in massive clusters to small Milky Way type satellite systems. Recently, this effect has also been detected in dark matter simulations of cosmological structure, but the degree of alignment of dark matter substructures in these studies is significantly stronger than seen in observations. In this paper we attempt to reconcile these two results by performing high-resolution numerical experiments on N-body multi-component models of triaxial galaxies orbiting in an external analytical potential. The large number of particles employed allows us to probe deep into the inner structure of the galaxy: we show that the discrepancy between observed galaxies and simulated dark matter halos is a natural consequence of induced radial shape twisting in the galaxy by the external potential. The degree of twisting depends strongly on the orbital phase and eccentricity of the satellite, and it can, under certain conditions, be significant at radii smaller than the dark matter scale radius. Such internal misalignments will have important consequences, both for the dynamical evolution of the galaxy itself, and for mass modeling of galaxies in clustered environments.\n"
